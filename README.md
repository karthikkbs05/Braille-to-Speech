# Braille-to-Speech
- The visually impaired community faces significant challenges in accessing information that is presented in visual form. One such challenge is the inability to read printed materials such as books, documents, and signage. Braille is a system of raised dots that can be read by touch, but many visually impaired individuals may not have access to Braille materials. 

- To address this problem, the "Braille to speech" project aims to create a device that can convert Braille text into audible speech. The device will consist of a Braille reader that can scan Braille text and convert it into digital text, which will then be processed by a speech synthesizer to produce an audio output.
